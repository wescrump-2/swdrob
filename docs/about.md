# Dice

Custom 3D dice roller extension for Savage Worlds fans.

You can select from 3 modes to roll Trait Rolls, Damage Rolls, or normal dice.

You can add dice to your dice tray by clicking one of the dice icons in the left bar.

When you want to roll the dice click the Roll button.

Once rolled the extension will use a physics simulation to determine the results of the roll.

**Trait Rolls**
To make a Trait Roll, select the Trait dice icon at the top. You can set any modifier to the roll with the
Modifier slider. The Target Number is usually 4 for most trait rolls; but you can set this to the Parry of 
your foe for attacking with Fighting/Shooting/Athletics(throwing). 

**Wild Die**
The Wild Die toggle turns on and off whether the roll is for a Wild Card or if the roll is made for an Extra(no wild die).
The Wild Die Die Type can be selected if the character has something other than a D6.

**Joker**
Drawing a Joker for an Action Card means the player gets a +2 for all Trait and Damage rolls. Selecting this toggle automatically adds this modifier bonus to the roll.

**Opposed Rolls**
Some rolls are opposed rolls whereby the Target Number is set to be the value of another roll. The Opposed Roll uses the prior roll in the roll history to set the Target Number to that value for determining the success and raises.

**Wounds and Fatigue**
The three Wound and two Fatigue toggle buttons allow you to set the conditions for a roll, each one subtracts one from the result.

The results will be caculated to show success and raises.
